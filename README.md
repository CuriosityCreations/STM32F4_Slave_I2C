__STM32F4 Asynchronous I2C Slave Example__
Hi, this is an example for i2c slave communication on the STM32F4
discovery board. I am going to be using a form of this on my class
project for EECS 473. You can see this project
[here](https://github.com/TeamElevate).

I hope this helps anyone that is trying to use their ST board as a
slave device, we are going to be using it as a slave of an Edison
board. It will act as a separate flight-controller that is controlled
by the Edison, and we'll be running OpenPilot on the ST. It's late, so
I'm going to stop rambling.
